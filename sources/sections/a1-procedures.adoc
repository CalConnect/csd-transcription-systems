== Procedures for the ISO XXXXX Registration Authority and the Registration Authorityâ€™s Advisory Committee


=== Registration Authority ISO XXXXX

ISO has designated a Registration Authority for
this International Standard, named ISO XXXXX/RA.

ISO is responsible for the addition of script codes
according to the procedures described in this
annex. See 4.5.

=== Responsibilities of the Registration Authority

==== Application for the addition of new script

codes and for the change of existing ones.
ISO XXXXX/RA shall receive and review
applications for the addition of new script codes
and for the change of existing script codes. It shall
suggest an assignment of a code when the
relevant criteria are met in accordance with the
rules given in A.3.3 and A.3.4, and inform the
applicant of the result of ISO XXXXX/RA actions.

==== Maintenance of list

ISO XXXXX/RA shall maintain an accurate list of
information associated with assigned script codes.
If necessary, it shall safeguard any confidential
information. It shall process updates of added
script codes and distribute them on a regular basis
to subscribers and other parties.

==== Other general responsibilities

ISO XXXXX/RA shall do the following:
* handle all aspects of the registration process in accordance with good business practice;
* indicate in its operations that it has been designated as ISO XXXXX/RA by ISO;
* provide an annual summary report on activity to the ISO/TC 46 Secretariat;
* provide advice on implementation and use of ISO XXXXX, as needed.

=== Joint Advisory Committee ISO XXXXX/RA-JAC

A Joint Advisory Committee named
ISO XXXXX/RA-JAC was established to advise the
ISO XXXXX/RA. It shall guide the application of the
coding rules given in ISO XXXXX.

==== Composition

ISO XXXXX/RA-JAC is composed of:

* 1 representative of the Registration Authority (see 4.5);
* 1 representative of the ISO 639-2/RA;
* 1 representative of ISO/TC 46 (nominated by ISO/TC 46);
* 1 representative of ISO/TC 37 (nominated by ISO/TC 37);
* 2 representatives of ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2 (nominated by ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2/WG2).

The ISO technical committees may nominate
substitute representatives.

===== Membership

The three technical committees may nominate
substitute representatives. The representative of
the Registration Authority will hold the chair. Up to
five technical experts may be asked to participate
as non-voting observers. The observers will be
entitled to receive documents sent to the
ISO XXXXX/RA-JAC membership and will be
expected to provide comments in return.

==== Working procedures within ISO XXXXX/RA-JAC

ISO XXXXX/RA-JAC will work primarily by
electronic correspondence and exceptionally by
meeting. If a meeting is necessary, it shall
preferably be held in conjunction with plenary
meetings of ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2 and ISO/IEC
JTC1/SC2/WG2 or ISO/TC 46 and ISO/TC 46/WG3.


==== Additions and deletions to the list of
entities, changes of codes
Requests for additions, deletions, and changes of
codes shall be supported by a justification. When
ISO XXXXX/RA consults ISO XXXXX/RA-JAC about
the proposed inclusion, deletion or change, and
suggests a code, ISO XXXXX/RA-JAC is obliged to
respond within one month.

NOTE: In general, script codes shall be added to ISO 15924
* when the script has been coded in ISO/IEC 10646, and
* when the script is agreed, by experts in
ISO 15924/RA-JAC, to be unique and a candidate
for encoding in the UCS.

This does not mean that the script will be encoded in the
UCS. Undeciphered scripts, such as Phaistos or
Rongorongo, are considered candidates but may not be
encoded because of their controversial nature (Phaistos
is known only from a single document, and Rongorongo
is so complex that without a decipherment it may not be
technically feasible to encode it in the near future).

==== Reservation of codes

When a request for inclusion of a new entity has
been rejected, ISO XXXXX/RA may reserve the
requested code for the use of the applicant and
other possible users. ISO XXXXX/RA will keep a
record of such reservations.

==== Creation of script codes

The creation of script codes is subject to the rules
described in ISO XXXXX, 4.1.

==== Voting procedures

Each member of ISO XXXXX/RA-JAC has one vote
and voting is obligatory. Voting shall be conducted
by electronic mail (e-mail) or in a meeting. Failure
to reply is considered as an abstention. An abstention
shall not prevent the addition of a script code
to ISO XXXXX. A vote must be unanimous for it to
pass. If an unanimous vote cannot be reached, a
second vote will be conducted. The letter ballot
shall be accompanied by all comments received.
At least four positive votes are required to pass.
Any amendments to ISO XXXXX shall be approved
following the voting rules before revisions are
published.
