[[iso-639]]
==== Usage of ISO 639 code elements

`iso639Code` represents code elements from <<ISO639-2>>,
<<ISO639-3>> and <<ISO639-5>> for reference to languages.


[[iso-15924]]
==== Usage of ISO 15924 code elements

`iso15924Code` represents code elements from <<ISO15924>> for reference to
scripts.


[[iso-3166]]
==== Usage of ISO 3166 code elements

`iso3166Code` represents country codes from <<ISO3166-1>>.


[[iso-8601]]
==== Usage of ISO 8601 expressions

`iso8601Expression` represents datetime expressions that are compliant with
<<ISO8601>>.

==== Description

authorityIdentifier:: An identifier that represents the conversion system authority.

name:: The identifiable short name that uniquely identifies the conversion
system authority.

remarks:: Any further notes.

[[sc-data-model]]
=== Conversion system data model and attributes

==== Diagram

==== Conversion System Relation

targetSystemCode:: The conversion system code of which this relation is a target.

type:: One or more types of relation that the conversion system has with the
target conversion system.


==== Spelling System

language:: An optional 3-letter code that identifies the source language being processed
by the written languages conversion system.
+
The language code should be qualified to a source of language codes.
For example, <<ISO639-2>>, <<ISO639-3>>, <<ISO639-5>>
contain language codes that can be selected from.
+
If a synonym is used from <<ISO639-2>>, the ISO 639-2/T associated code should
be used. ISO 639-2/T codes are intended to be used for terminology applications.

scriptCode:: A 4-letter code from <<ISO15924>> that identifies the script of the
spelling system.

countryCode:: An optional 2-letter code from <<ISO3166-1>> that identifies the
country associated with the spelling system.

extension:: An ad hoc string to refer to a non-default spelling system of a
language.


==== Written Languages Conversion System

code:: A code that identifies the written languages conversion system.

name:: A name that represents the written languages conversion system.

sourceSpelling:: The spelling system used in the source text.

targetSpelling:: The spelling system used in the output text.

identifyingSegment:: A system may be uniquely identified, amongst systems
maintained by the same authority, by an identifier, an edition, a version or a
sequence of characters.
+
This element is mandatory if the authority manages or plans to manage multiple
written languages conversion systems.
+
It may be derived from the adoption date if and only if that does not cause
duplicates.
Otherwise the adoption date shall be complemented by the name or number of the
standard / technical specification, or some other data element.
+
[example]
`2013` is the identifying segment of the system coded as `UN:lao:Latn:2013`.


relations:: Written languages conversion systems can be related to other written
languages conversion systems in a number of ways.
For example, a written languages conversion system may represent an adoption or
variant of another written languages conversion system.
+
Hierarchical structures of written languages conversion systems can be constructed by means
of relationships.
+
This element is optional.
+
`aliasOf`::: the current system is an alias to the target system, the conversion process is identical
`adoptedFrom`::: the current system is adopted from the target system, the conversion process may not be identical
`supersedes`::: the current system supersedes the target system
`replacedBy`::: the current system is replaced by the target system
`relatedTo`::: the current system is related to the target system
`basedOn`::: the current system is based on the target system, the conversion process inherits certain attributes from the target system.


status:: A conversion system code may be optionally marked as deprecated or
preferred.
+
NOTE: The deprecation marker in no way indicates deprecation of the system
itself.


remarks:: Any further notes.
+
The date of the adoption of the written languages conversation system by the authority may
be noted in the remarks.
+
A typical use case is to show its original code from the original system from
where this code has been imported.
+
[example]
`NOTE: OGC 11-122r1 code urd_Arab2Latn_ODNI_2004`
