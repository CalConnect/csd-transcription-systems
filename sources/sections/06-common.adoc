[[iso-639]]
==== Usage of ISO 639 code elements

`iso639Code` represents code elements from <<ISO639-2>>,
<<ISO639-3>> and <<ISO639-5>> for reference to languages.


[[iso-15924]]
==== Usage of ISO 15924 code elements

`iso15924Code` represents code elements from <<ISO15924>> for reference to
scripts.


[[iso-3166]]
==== Usage of ISO 3166 code elements

`iso3166Code` represents country codes from <<ISO3166-1>>.


[[iso-8601]]
==== Usage of ISO 8601 expressions

`iso8601Expression` represents datetime expressions that are compliant with
<<ISO8601>>.


[[sc-authority-data-model]]
=== System authority data model and attributes

==== Conversion System Authority

authorityIdentifier:: An identifier that represents the conversion system authority (<<titular-segment>>).

name:: The identifiable short name that uniquely identifies the conversion
system authority.

remarks:: Any further notes.


==== Authority Identifier

Either a 2-letter `iso3166Code`,
or a `String` under the constraints of <<construction-of-the-alphabetic-identifier>>.

==== Written Languages Conversion System

code:: A code that identifies the written languages conversion system.

name:: A name that represents the written languages conversion system.

authority:: The conversion system authority under which this conversion system belongs.

sourceSpelling:: The spelling system used in the source text.

targetSpelling:: The spelling system used in the output text.

identifyingSegment:: An identifier that distinguishes the written languages
conversion system from others with the same conversion system autority and
spelling scopes.


relations:: Written languages conversion systems can be related to other written
languages conversion systems in a number of ways.
For example, a written languages conversion system may represent an adoption or
variant of another written languages conversion system.
+
Hierarchical structures of written languages conversion systems can be constructed by means
of relationships.
+
This element is optional.


codeStatus:: A optional code that identifies the current status of the conversion system
code itself.

systemStatus:: A optional code that identifies the current status of the written
languages conversion system itself.

remarks:: Any further notes.
+
The date of the adoption of the written languages conversation system by the authority may
be noted in the remarks.
+
A typical use case is to show its original code from the original system from
where this code has been imported.
+
[example]
`NOTE: OGC 11-122r1 code urd_Arab2Latn_ODNI_2004`


==== Spelling System

Either `language` or `scriptCode` needs to be present.

language:: A 3-letter code that identifies the source language being
processed.

scriptCode:: A 4-letter code from <<ISO15924>> that identifies the script of the
spelling system.

countryCode:: An optional 2-letter code from <<ISO3166-1>> that identifies the
country associated with the spelling system.

extension:: An optional ad hoc string to refer to a non-default spelling system of a
language.


==== Conversion System Relation

targetSystem:: The conversion system of which this relation is a target.

type:: One or more types of relation that the conversion system has with the
target conversion system.


==== Conversion System Code Status

Examples of system code statuses:

`preferred`:: the current system code is marked as "preferred"

`deprecated`:: the current system code is marked as "deprecated"
+
NOTE: The deprecation marker in no way indicates deprecation of the system
itself.



==== Conversion System Status

Examples of system statuses:

`former` :: the current system is marked as "former"

`current` :: the current system is marked as "current"

`inactive`:: the current system is marked as "inactive"
+
[example] When a system has been deprecated, but not superseded, thus not
qualified for a relation, then this system status applies.


==== Conversion System Relation Type

Examples of relation types:

`aliasOf`:: the current system is an alias to the target system, the conversion process is identical

`adoptedFrom`:: the current system is adopted from the target system, the conversion process may not be identical

`supersedes`:: the current system supersedes the target system

`supersededBy`:: the current system is superseded by the target system

`relatedTo`:: the current system is related to the target system

`basedOn`:: the current system is based on the target system, the conversion process inherits certain attributes from the target system.
