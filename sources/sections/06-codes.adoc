== Script conversion systems

=== General

Script conversion systems are used to convert writing systems
into other scripts, and in the case of romanization systems, into Roman script.

=== Data model and attributes

==== General

image::system.png[]


==== Code

A code that identifies the script conversion system.


==== Name

A name that represents the script conversion system.


==== Source script code

The script code of the script used in the source text.


==== Target script code

The script code of the script used in the output text.


==== Language code

The language code that identifies the source language being processed
by the script conversion system.


==== Remarks

Any further notes.


=== Code and identifier

==== Principles for inclusion in the list of transliteration and romanization systems

===== List

The list of transliteration and romanization systems in this document includes known
transliteration and romanization systems from official sources.


===== Source of names

Names and description of transliteration and romanization systems are
obtained from authoritative sources.

===== Current status of names

Script conversion systems listed in this document are intended to reflect the current situation, at the time of issue of the latest update of this document.



==== Principles for allocation of code elements

===== Relationship with names

Script conversion systems have codes in the following format:

[source]
----
[script-conversion-system-authority-code]-[script-conversion-system-code]
----

[example]
`iso-slv` for <<ISO9>>, the international standard for transliteration of Cyrillic characters into Latin characters for Slavic and non-Slavic languages.


===== Construction of the alphabetic code

The following rules are to be adhered to for the assignment of the alphabetic code:

* The alphabetic code uses combinations, in upper case, of 3 fixed letters of the 26-character Latin alphabet, allowing for close to stem:[3^26] combinations.

* Codes shall encourage descriptive and distinguishable alphabetic names.


===== User assigned code elements

If users need code elements to represent transliteration and romanization systems not included in the script conversion system registry, the code prefix of `zz` can be used.

The code length for the transliteration and romanization system identifier must be 3 letters.

Such transliteration and romanization system identifiers are in the following format:

[source]
----
xx-[script-conversion-system-authority-code]-[script-conversion-system-code]
----

////
[example]
`xx-unece-cet` is an example of a user-assigned private code for a script conversion system published by the UN/ECE.
////

NOTE: Users are advised that the above series of codes are not universally used, those code elements are not compatible between different entities.

The list of items composing the content of the country code is initially defined in <<annex-system-codes>>.
Additional and new entries will be listed by the ISO {docnumber}/AG.
