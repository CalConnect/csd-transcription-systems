== Script conversion systems

=== General

Script conversion systems are used to convert writing systems
into other scripts, and in the case of romanization systems, into Roman script.

=== Data model and attributes

==== General

image::system.png[]


==== Code

A code that identifies the script conversion system.


==== Name

A name that represents the script conversion system.


==== Source script code

The script code of the script used in the source text.


==== Target script code

The script code of the script used in the output text.


==== Language code

The language code that identifies the source language being processed
by the script conversion system.


==== Edition

The edition, or version, of the script conversion system, in string form.
It may or may not be derived from the adoption date.

[example]
`2013` is the edition year of the system `un-lao-2013`.


==== Adoption date

The date of the adoption of the script conversation system by the authority.


==== Remarks

Any further notes.


=== Code and identifier

==== Principles for inclusion in the list of transliteration and romanization systems

===== List

The list of transliteration and romanization systems in this document includes known
transliteration and romanization systems from official sources.


===== Source of names

Names and description of transliteration and romanization systems are
obtained from authoritative sources.


===== Current status of names

Script conversion systems listed in this document are intended to reflect the current situation, at the time of issue of the latest update of this document.



==== Principles for allocation of code elements

===== Relationship with names

Script conversion systems have codes in the following format:

[source]
----
[script-conversion-system-authority-code]"-"[script-conversion-system-code]"-"[script-conversion-system-edition]
----

[example]
`iso-9-1995` for <<ISO9>>, the international standard for transliteration of Cyrillic characters into Latin characters for Slavic and non-Slavic languages.


===== Construction of the alphabetic code

The following rules are to be adhered to for the assignment of the alphabetic code:

* The alphabetic code uses combinations, in upper case, of 3 fixed letters of the 26-character Latin alphabet, allowing for close to stem:[3^26] combinations.

* Codes shall encourage descriptive and distinguishable alphabetic names.


===== User assigned code elements

If users need code elements to represent transliteration and romanization systems not included in the script conversion system registry, the code prefix of `zz` can be used.

The code length for the transliteration and romanization system identifier must be 3 letters.

Such transliteration and romanization system identifiers are in the following format:

[source]
----
"xx-"[script-conversion-system-authority-code]"-"[script-conversion-system-code]"-"[script-conversion-system-edition]
----

////
[example]
`xx-unece-cet` is an example of a user-assigned private code for a script conversion system published by the UN/ECE.
////

NOTE: Users are advised that the above series of codes are not universally used, those code elements are not compatible between different entities.


==== List of transliteration and romanization system and their code elements

The list of items composing the content of the country code is initially defined in <<annex-system-codes>>.
Additional and new entries will be listed by the ISO {docnumber}/AG.

Data attributes provided in the list is defined in <<sc-data-model>>.
