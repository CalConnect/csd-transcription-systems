== Scope

This International Standard provides a code for the
presentation of transliteration systems.

The codes were devised for use in terminology, lexicography,
bibliography, and linguistics, but they may be used
for any application requiring the expression of
scripts in coded form. This International Standard
also includes guidance on the use of transliteration system codes
in some of these applications.
